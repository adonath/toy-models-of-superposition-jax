# Toy Models of Superposition: Replication in JAX

This repository contains a replication of Antropic's "Toy Models of Superposition" in JAX.

The original code can be found here: https://github.com/anthropics/toy-models-of-superposition/tree/main


## Getting Started

I would recommeend to use `uv`, which will automatically detect the `uv.lock` file and create and reproducible environment:

```bash
uv run make.py 
```
